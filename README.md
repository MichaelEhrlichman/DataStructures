# DataStructures

These are my solutions to the Data Structures course by by University of California San Diego & HSE University, hosted on Coursera.

Week 1
1. [Use a stack to determine if the (),{},[] in a string are balanced](CheckBrackets)
2. [Resursive algorithm to calculate the height of a rooted tree](TreeHeight)
3. [Use a queue to simulate a network packet processor](NetworkPacketProcessing)
4. [Implement a stack with constant time Max operation](StackWithMax)
5. [O(n) max integer in a sliding window](SlidingWindowWithMax)

Week 2
1. [Turn integer array into a min heap](Array2Heap)
2. [Build a min heap class to make a cluster scheduler](Scheduler)
3. [Use disjoint set union to simulate database table merges](TableMerge)

Week 3
1. [Implement a phone book using direct addressing](DirectAddressing)
2. [Store strings using a hash table with stringing](HasingStrings)
3. [Use Rabin Karp to find substrings](RabinKarp)
4. [Use hashing to determing if two substrings are equal](SubstringEquality)
5. [Use hasing to find the longest common pair of substrings in a string](LongestCommonSubstring)
6. [Hashing to find longest common substrings with some number of tolerable mismatches](PatternMatchingWithMismatches)

Week 4
1. [Output in-, pre-, and post-order traversal of a binary tree](BinaryTreeTraversal)
2. [Check if given tree meets binary search tree condition](SearchTreeProperty)
3. [Check if given tree meets binary search tree condition, allowing for equal keys](SearchTreePropertyHard)
4. [Implement an integer splay tree that supports add, del, find, and sum over range](SetRangeSum)
5. - To facilitate debugging, includes basic tree visualization using graphics.py
